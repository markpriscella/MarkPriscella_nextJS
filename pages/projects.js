            I designed, implemented, and tested (using the BOOST 
            testing framework) a linear feedback shift register 
            (LFSR). The LFSR was then used to modify an imageâ€™s 
            pixel properties to distort the image. When the distorted
            image is ran through the program a second time, the original
            image is outputted. The application is written in C++ and 
            uses the SFML library.

            File Sharing Application (Airdrop Clone) <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I organized and led a team of 4 to design a file sharing 
            application (Airdrop clone). We designed the app with 
            security in mind to keep the files as safe as possible. 
            I defined milestones for my team and organized regular 
            check-ins to monitor progress and strengthen team-wide 
            communication. The application was written in python and 
            used JSON to store data.

            "Create a Date" Mobile App <br></br> <br></br>
            I designed a non-native mobile application that helps 
            couples and friends decide what to do when going out. 
            The user populates both a restaurant and 
            activity list, and the app randomly select one 
            item from each list to present to the user. 
            I made this because my friends and I often have 
            a tought time deciding what to do when we go out 
            so I thought it would be fun to make an app that 
            decides for us. "Create a Date" is written in the 
            dart language and is developed using the flutter 
            framework developed by google. The data is stored 
            using SQLite.
