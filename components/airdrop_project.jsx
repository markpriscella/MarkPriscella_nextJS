        File Sharing Application (Airdrop Clone) <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I organized and led a team of 4 to design a file sharing 
        application (Airdrop clone). We designed the app with 
        security in mind to keep the files as safe as possible. 
        I defined milestones for my team and organized regular 
        check-ins to monitor progress and strengthen team-wide 
        communication. The application was written in python and 
        used JSON to store data.
